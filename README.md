Automatically read temperatures of individual livestock to provide early warning for illness. **monday.com** board at https://thermafy-group.monday.com/boards/3049767712

## Files

### best.pt
Weights for a YOLOv5l model trained on a sample of the `clean thermal` dataset

### renamer
1. Read optical or thermal images (depending on value of `--therm`) from `--in`
2. Perform OCR on the timestamps using Tesseract
3. Rename files in `--in` accordingly

### video_to_frames
1. Read videos from `--in`
2. Concatenate into a single video
3. Split into frames and write to `--out`
4. ~~Sort frames by-cow, and by train and test according to `--test_split`~~

### frames_to_labels
1. Read frames from `--in` (thermal images)
2. For each frame, perform Otsu thresholding and return the bounding boxes of the two biggest contours
3. Transform bounding boxes so they apply to the corresponding optical image
4. Write the resulting bounding boxes in YOLO .txt annotation format to `--out`

### frames_to_faces
1. Read images from `--in`
2. For each image, run YOLO inference and write the cropped faces to `--out`. Sort faces by-cow, and into train and test sets according to `--test_split`.

### video_to_demo
Process recording of optical & thermal images side-by-side, superimposing bounding boxes obtained by Otsu thresholding (thermal) and YOLO inference (normal).
